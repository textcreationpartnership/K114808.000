    _ I. 
A Deſcription of the State of Great Britain;
written Eleven Hundred Years ſince, by that Ancient and Famous
Author, GILDAS, ſurnamed the WISE; and for the Excellency
of the Work tranſlated into Engliſh, &c. with a Picture
of the Author prefix'd, W. Marſhal, ſculp. Printed by John
Hancock, 12o. 1652. pages 327. beſides the Introduction,
&c.

    _ II. 
A Dialogue betwene a Knyght and a Clerke,
concernynge the Power Spiritual and Temporal. Imprinted at
London in Flete-Strete, in the Houſe of Tho.
Berthelet, near to the Cundite, at the Sign of Lucrece: cum
Privilegio: without Date or Name of the Author. 52 Pages 8voAltho' this Dialogue is undated, it may appear to have been
printed at the Beginning of our Reformation; and tho' the Author's
Name was not yet publiſh'd to it, it is well known to have been written by
that famous Clerk and Schoolman WILLIAM of OCCHAM, ſo called from being born
in a Village of that Name in Surrey, as Camden and others
have obſerv'd. It was written by our Author ſo early as the Year 1305, if
the MS. Note on the Copy before me is right. There was another Edition of it
afterwards in 1540, wherein it is ſaid to be written by William of
Occham, the great Philoſopher, in Engliſh and
Latin. [Extat. Lat. in Goldaſt. Monarch. T. Ed.] The Author
was Scholar to John Duns Scotus, and afterwards, his Antagoniſt. In
their grand Scholaſtic Controverſy, Scotus was diſtinguiſhed
Father of the Reals, and Occham of the Nominals.
Occham, fluſhed with his Succeſs, undertook Pope John the
23d, and gave a mortal Wound to his Temporal Power over Princes. He
got a good Guardian, Lewis of Bavaria the Emperor, whoſe
Court was his Sanctuary, but he was excommunicated by the Pope; and the
Maſters of Paris condemned him for an Heretic, and burnt his Books;
which Fuller conceives to be the Cauſe why Luther was ſo
vers'd in his Works, which he had at his Fingers ends; being the ſole
Schoolman in his Library whom he eſteem'd. The Pope being afterwards, it
ſeems, reconciled to him, he was reſtored to his State with the Repute of
an Acute Schoolman. Fox, in his Book of Martyrs, Ed. 1576.
fol. 376. ſays, that in the Time of K. Edward II. 
"Gulielmus Occham was a worthy
Divine, and of a right ſincere Judgment, as the Times wou'd then either give
or ſuffer." The ſame Hiſtorian further, fol. 393. mentions this
Dialogue, as of Occham's Writing, tho' it appeared without
the Name of its Author. He there alſo mentions another of his Books, called
his Queſtions and Diſtinctions; and quotes John Sleidan's
Hiſtory in his Commendation; who, telling us the ſaid Occham
flouriſhed in the Year 1326. gives us an Abſtract of another of his Books,
on the Authority of the Biſhop of Rome. Theſe two laſt, with two
more of his writing, were printed abroad, between the Years 1491 and 1496, as
appears in Corn. à Beughem's Incunab. Typographiae,
12mo. Amſt. 1688. p. 100. As for the Author's Death, ſome place it in 1330,
others ſeventeen Years later. See Leland, Bale, Pits, Fuller, Dr.
Cave, Du Pin, &c..

In this Boke is conteined the Names of the
Baylyfs, Cuſtoſe, Mayers, and Sherefs of the Cyte of
London, from the Tyme of Kynge Richard the Fyrſt; and
alſo the Artycles of the Chartour and Lybartyes of the ſame Cyte;
and of the Chartour and Lybartyes of England: with other dyvers
Maters, good and neceſſary for every Cytezen to underſtond
and knowThis is the only Title, which appears
in two fair Copies of this very ſcarce old Book, which I have ſeen; and the
ſaid Title is at the Head of the Kalendar or Table of Contents, which is
printed in double Columns, as moſt of the Book alſo is. But it ſeems to
want the firſt Leaf, which might contain a more general Title, and
poſſibly the Name alſo of its Author. For the firſt Signature in both
thoſe Copies is A 2, the Book not being numerically paged at top, nor has it
any Printer's Name, or Date when printed. The late Mr. Hearne in his
Copy has entitled it, The Cuſtomes of London, or ARNOLDE's
Chronicle: And in ſome Catalogue I have ſeen it is call'd,
after the Title of the ſecond Chapter, The Articles of the Charter and
Liberties of the City of London, by one Arnold a Citizen
of London, who liv'd 1519: Whence probably that Copy might want
the whole firſt Chapter; at the End whereof (which gives it the Name of a
Chronicle) it appears plainly to be continued down to the 12th, or
rather, one Year being miſ-printed twice over, the 13th of Henry the
8th, which was 1521; in which Year this ſmall Folio was probably printed.
There is the Name of R. A. and Richard Arnolde mention'd in
many Forms of his Inſtruments, as a Citizen Haberdaſher and
Merchant of London; who might be the Author of this Collection; which
has (among ſome few Matters of Digreſſion) ſeveral notable old
Inſtruments and Memorials in it: And tho' it may have been ſeen by ſome
few Antiquaries who have written of this Metropolis, yet is a Work, for the
generality, ſo little known, that Biſhop Nicholſon and others,
who have attempted to give Accounts of our Hiſtorical Writers, are utterly
ſilent hereof., &c. Fol.

    _ XIII. 
The Dictes or Sayengis of the Philoſophres:
Tranſlated out of Frenſhe by ANTONE Erle of RYVYERS,
&c. Enprynted byWilliam Caxtonat Weſtmeſtre. Folio, 1477. 75 LeavesThis
is a Title gather'd from what the Tranſlator mentions in his
Preface, and the Printer, in his Concluſion of the Book; for the Art
of Printing had not yet arrived at the Diſtinction of Title-pages in
Form. Further, we may remark of this antique Specimen of that, then,
new Art in England, that if it is not our firſt Book printed here,
it may be the ſecond, tho' printed ſo late in the Year above-mention'd as
November; and tho' ſome other ſmaller Work might be printed by
Caxton the ſame Year. For tho' the Knowledge of two, printed before
it, by him, is deſcended to us; yet one is expreſsly ſaid to be printed
abroad, and the other has no place mention'd where it was printed. Dr.
Conyers Middleton obſerves, 
"It has been generally aſſerted and
believ'd, that all Caxton's Books were printed in the Abbey of
Westminſter; yet we have no Aſſurance of it from himſelf, nor
any mention of the place before 1477." Which Obſervation is plainly
drawn from the Date of this Book, and it appears thereby to be the firſt, at
leaſt now in being, which was printed at Weſtminſter; 
"So that he had been printing ſeveral Years
without telling us where." See the ſaid Doctor's Origin of Printing
in England, 4to. Cambr. 1735. p. 20. We are inform'd
there is in being a fair MS of this Tranſlation, and, what ſome may think
yet a greater Curioſity, an Illumination in it, repreſenting King
Edward IV. his Queen, and the Prince, with the Picture alſo of this
Antony Wydeville Earl Rivers, preſenting Caxton to
the King. But more particularly of the printed Book, we obſerve, it is
perform'd on a good thick Paper, in which may be diſcern'd its Maker's Mark
to be ſomewhat like a Pair of Horns, with a Flower over them. The Pages have
no Numbers at top, nor Signatures, or Catch-words at bottom; theſe being
more modern Improvements in Printing, at leaſt in England. The
Diviſion of the Chapters is ſeldom by any larger Space than the other
lines; only the three firſt lines of every Chapter being ſhorter than the
reſt, leave room, towards the Margin, for the initial Letter, which
is always a ſmall one; and the ſecond Letter of the Word which begins
every Chapter, is always a Capital. As to Orthography, the ſame
Words are not always ſpell'd alike, and ſeveral of the Proper Names are
much obſcur'd by the old Manner of ſpelling them, eſpecially after the
French Copy: and as to Pointing, there are but two ſorts of
Stops uſed; the one, a little Daſh, the other, a little Croſs; and
ſeldom either uſed as a Period at the End of a complete Sentence, it being
thought ſufficient Diſtinction to allow a little longer Space there than
between other Words, and to begin the next Sentence with a Capital. More
Obſervations might hence be made on the Rudiments of Printing in
England; but to thoſe who are not curious after ſuch Inquiries,
poſſibly the greater Number, theſe may be enough. Of the noble Earl
Rivers, who tranſlated this Book, much might be written: therefore
we ſhall only obſerve here, that he publiſh'd one or more Books after
this, and refer thoſe who would know more of him to the Chronicles, and
eſpecially to Dugdale's Baronage; where it may appear what a Man of
ſuperior. Merit and Dignity he was among many eminent of his Name; alſo
how he was barbarouſly put to death in June 1483, at
Pontefract in Yorkſhire, by the Procurement of
Richard Duke of Glouceſter, then Protector, being aged
about 41 Years, as we compute from the Account of his Age at the Death of his
Mother Jacquett Dutcheſs of Bedford in 1472, as it
ſtands upon Record in the Eſcheats..

The Fyrſte Part of the Actes of ENGLISH

Collected owte of their owne Legendes and Chronycles; by JOHAN BALE,
(at the End ſaid to be) Imprynted at London, by Abraham
Vele, &c. 1551. containing 78 Leaves 8vo. To this is joined, The Second Part, or Contynuacyon of the
ENGLISH VOTARIES; comprehendynge their unchaſte Examples for 200
Years ſpace; from the Year One Thouſand, from Chriſtes Incarnation,
to the Reign of King JOHAN; Collected of theyr owne Wryters, by
JOHAN BALE. Imprynted at London, for J. BALE, 1551,
&c. Cum Privilegio ad imprimendum ſolum. 120 Leaves 8voTho' the firſt Part of theſe Engliſh
Votaries, was Collected by our Author John Bale, in the
Year 1546, and the Second Part, in 1550, as appears in his Concluſions of
them: yet neither of them were printed till the Year 1551, which was
the Year before he was made Biſhop of Oſſory. In this Edition
was probably publiſh'd the Author's Dedication to King
Edward VI. however wanting in our Copy, which is otherwiſe a very
fair and perfect one: becauſe, in the Edition printed on a larger Black
Letter, by John Tyſdale, Anno 1560, which was after that King's
Death; we find ſuch a Dedication of Bale's to his ſaid Majeſty,
and alſo becauſe we ſee, at the End of the Epiſtle to the Second Part,
even of the firſt Edition, there is a Wooden Print of our Author,
preſenting his Book to the ſaid King Edward. In this Dedication we
obſerve, that Bale deſign'd to publiſh Two Parts more of theſe
Engliſh Votaries, or Hiſtorical Examples of the abominable
Corruptions among our Biſhops, Monks, Nuns, &c. which wou'd have
deduced the ſaid Collections down to his own Time: For his Words to the King
diſplaying the Scheme of the whole, by ſhewing what theſe two Parts
already publiſh'd do, and what thoſe to be publiſh'd were to treat of,
are as follows. 
"How the great Adverſary of God,
Antichriſt, hath ſens Chriſtes Aſcention, wrought in his wicked
Courſe, to deprave theſe two Miniſtrations (the Explanation of God's
Word, and Government of the People) and to cauſe them to ſerve his moſte
blaſphemous and filthy Affectes; the Firſt Two Partes of my
Engliſh Votaries, here preſent, doth plentiouſly ſhew; and my
hope is, that the Two Lattre Partes which will, God willing, moſt
ſpedily follow, ſhal declare it yet much more at large. I have therein
decreed, for difference of the Bookes; and apt Arguments of the Matters
contained in them, to give them Four ſeveral Titles; of Riſing,
Building, Holding and Falling. For the Firſt Part
treateth of their Upriſing to Miſchief by th' old Idolaters in the Reign
of Perdicion: The Second Part ſheweth of their haſty Building by
the hipocritiſhe Monks to eſtabliſh the wicked Kingdom of Antichriſte:
The Third Part will declare the crafty upholding of their proud
Degrees and Poſſeſſions, by the wily and ſubtil ſlaightes of the
Four Orders of Friers: And the Fourth Part ſhall manifeſt their
horrible Fall in this latter Age, by the grounded Doctrines of the true
Preachers and Writers.".

Leather, with the Leaves gilt, Writing very fair, and Arms of our Kings, with

all blazon'd in their proper Colours; is to be ſeen among the MS.
Collections, in the Hands of Mr. Thomas Oſborne, for whom this
Britiſh Librarian is printed. The Author's Name was firſt written
Tilſon, but, by Correction, as it is above. We find that his
particular Friend, or Patron, was John Lord Byron, whoſe
ſingular Favours to him, has, ſays he, fol 299. for
ever oblig'd me to himſelf and Family. Tho' he mentions none of the
Nobility, created later than the Year 1645, and the Date in the Title-Page of
the Volume, is but two Years later; we obſerve, by his mentioning the Death
of Francis Lord Cottington, fol. 288, That he muſt have
writ the Concluſion of this Book, at leaſt, ſo late as the Year 1652. If
ſome few Miſtakes have eſcaped in the Blazonry, or in the Hiſtorical
Account of the Alliances and Iſſue, they are not greater, perhaps, than
what might be reaſonably expected in any other Heraldical Work, where ſuch
Diſtinctions are undertaken; eſpecially in ſuch Extent of Time, and,
conſequently, ſuch Variety of Families..

Maps and Proſpects, with the Coats of Arms belonging to every Family.
Performed by W. SMITH and W. WEBB, Gentlemen: Publiſhed by
Mr. DANIEL KING. To which is annexed, a Chronology of all its
Rulers and Governors, in Church and State. Alſo an excellent Diyſcourſe
of the Iſle of MAN. Fol. 1656Thus the common
printed Title; but there is alſo a Title-Page printed from a Copper Plate
bound before it, which entitles the Book more briefly, A Deſcription
Hiſtorical and Geographical of the County Palatine of Cheſter,
illuſtrated with divers Figures cut in Copper, and publiſh'd by
Daniel King of Cheſter, 1656. 'Tis inviron'd with Branches forming
an Oval, containing the Arms of all the Earls of Cheſter, from
Hugh Lupus to Henry, eldeſt Son of King James I.
and on the Sides thereof, are two Standards ſupported by Wolves, and bearing
the Arms of the County; which are in one of them, 3 Wheat-Sheaves; and in the
other, a Wolf's Head eraz'd. As for this Publiſher, Daniel King,
tho' Ant. Wood might receive a private Character of him from a noted
Author, in a Letter, intimating he was an ignorant and knaviſh Fellow, we
ſee not, with what Juſtice the ſame is publiſhed, in relation to this
Book. It is plain, that he commendably procured theſe Accounts of
Cheſter, which might never have ſeen the Light but for him; and
has faithfully publiſhed them, juſtly aſcribing every Part to its due
Owner; that he hath induſtriouſly adorned them with many Sculptures; has
aſſumed no part to himſelf but what was viſibly his own, and was in
ſo much Credit with the Gentry of the County, that many of them were
evidently his Patrons, and Encouragers: wherefore we cannot but think rather
with Dr. Fuller, That ſeeing this Daniel King had, in his
Travels, got the Myſtery both of Surveying and Engraving,
and uſed the ſame to enliven the Deſcriptions above, which he
ſet forth, with ſo many Cuts of Heraldry and Topography,"That Cheſhire is chiefly beholden
to his Pains." Nay, he further acknowledges himſelf ſo much beholden to
the particular Courteſy of the Man, through his many Communications, as to
have verefied his Anagram, and been even a kind Angel to
him..
